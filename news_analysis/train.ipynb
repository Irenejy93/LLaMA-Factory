      "   ‘JP모간 헬스케어 콘퍼런스’ 시사점 공유한 전망 보고서 발간    글로벌 빅파마의 유망 바이오텍 볼트온 M&A 전략 지속 전망    트럼프 2기 정부의 정책, 인공지능(AI)·디지털 혁신 등 화두    이 기사는 02월 07일 10:31     마켓인사이트    에 게재된 기사입니다. 올해 바이오·헬스케어 인수합병(M&A) 시장에서 잠재력을 가진 중소 바이오 기업이 주목받을 것으로 전망됐다.7 일 삼일PwC가 발간한 ‘글로벌 바이오·헬스케어 M&A 2025년 전망’ 보고서에 따르면 올해 바이오·헬스케어 M&A 시장의 키워드는 글로벌 빅파마의 M&A 주도, 트럼프 2기 정부의 정책, 인공지능(AI)·디지털 혁신 등이 꼽혔다.이번 보고서는 지난달 13일부터 4일간 미국 샌프란시스코에서 열린 JP모간 헬스케어 콘퍼런스에 참석한 뒤 전망 및 시사점을 공유하기 위해 발간됐다.이번 행사에서 존슨앤드존슨의 인트라-셀룰러 테라피스 인수(최대 146억 달러, 한화 약 21조 원), 일라이 릴리의 스콜피온 테라퓨틱스 인수(최대 25억 달러, 한화 약 3조6000억원) 등 대형 거래들이 발표됐다.보고서는 “콘퍼런스에서는 대형 M&A뿐만 아니라  중소형 규모의 거래도 강조됐다”며 \"M&A의 전략적 중요성이 강조되면서 중소형 거래가 시장에 더 큰 영향을 미칠 수 있다” 고 언급했다.글로벌 빅파마가 보유한 특허의 만기가 끝나면서 M&A를 활발하게 진행할 유인이 될 것으로 봤다. 이에 따라 확실한 연구 결과와 시장 잠재력을 가진 중소 바이오 기업이 상당한 주목을 받을 가능성이 높다고 봤다.트럼프 2기 정부의 바이오·헬스케어 정책이 시장에 끼치는 영향이 클 것으로 전망됐다. 보고서는 “규제 완화, 기술 개발 장려, M&A 촉진 등 긍정적인 방향의 논의가 주를 이루었다”며 “특히 생물보안법에 주목할 필요가 있다”고 바라봤다.생물보안법은 미국 바이오산업  보호와 안전, 국가 안보에 위협이 될 수 있는 바이오 기술의 악용을 막기 위한 법안이다. 실질적으로는 중국의 바이오 기업을 견제하고 미국 내 사업을 제한하려는 목적이 강한 것으로 평가됐다.보고서는 “미국 시장에서 중국 위탁 개발 생산(CDMO) 업체 활동이 제 한될 경우를 대비해 한국 기업은 이를 대체하기 위한 노력을 기울여야 한다”며 “정부 차원의 지원 및 외교 전략도 병행되어야 한다”고 강조했다.인공지능(AI) 및 디지털이 바이오·헬스케어 분야에서도 주요 화두가 될 것으로 전망됐다. AI 및 디지털 기반 기술은 약물 설계 및 개발을 가속하는 도구이자, 인력 문제와 인플레이션, 부족한 의료 서비스 격차를 메우는 데 필수적이라는 분 석이다. AI, 디지털 및 IT 기반의 메드테크(MedTech), 디지털 헬스케어, 원격 의료, 헬스케어 분석 기업이 매력적인 투자 대상으로 부상할 것으로 예상됐다.남승수 삼일PwC 바이오·헬스케어 전문팀 파트너는 “이번 콘퍼런스에서 한국바이오협회가 주관한 글 로벌 기업공개(IR) 등이 성황리에 진행돼 글로벌 시장에서 국내 바이오·헬스케어의 위상이 빠르게 커지고 있음을 보여줬다\"며 \"M&A 관점에서 잠재력을 가진 한국 바이오·헬스케어 회사들이 올해 상당한 주목을 받을 가능성이 높다”고 전망했다.최석철 기자 dolsoi@hankyung.com         ⓒ 한국경제 &   hankyung.com , 무단전재 및 재배포 금지<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{'summary': '올해 바이오·헬스케어 시장에서는 글로벌 대기업의 인수합병(M&A) 전략이 지속되는 가운데, 중소 바이오 기업의 잠재력이 주목될 전망입니다. 트럼프 2기 정부의 정책 변화, 인공지능 및 디지털 혁신도 중요한 화두로 떠오르고 있습니다. 특히 AI 기반 기술은 약물 개발과 의료 서비스 개선에 핵심 역할을 하며, 한국 바이오 기업들도 글로벌 시장에서 위상이 높아질 것으로 기대됩니다.','sktlist': ['JP모간', '삼일PwC', '존슨앤드존슨', '일라이 릴리', '트럼프 정부', '한국바이오협회', '한국경제'],'sentiment': '1', 'advr': '0'}<|eot_id|>\n",
